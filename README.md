# React-Devilish
A devilishly simple fullstack React example. I made this because I wanted a simple, lightweight scaffold for my future web projects - it avoids being all-in-one megaproject for making the Next Big Thingâ„¢. It also servers as a "cheat-sheet" for some best practices. There's no testframework included, so you'll definitely want to get one of those yourself. 

##Installing
`yo intsall react-devilish`
`npm install`

That's it!

## The Stack
* React
* Flux
* Node
* Express
* Bootstrap

## Others
* Browserify
* ESLint w/AirBNB and ES6 styleguides
* Request-Promise

## Usage
* npm run start to run nodemon & watchify in parallel
* npm run build to build the client with browserify
* npm run watch-client to watchify
* npm run watch-client to nodemon
